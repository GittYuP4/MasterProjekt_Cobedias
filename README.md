# MasterProjekt Cobedias

### Idea and goal
This is the prototype for the Master Project at the Department of Informatics at UZH of Anna, Ivo, Joachim and Fabio. The goal of it is to improve the current Cobedias version with new ideas. You can find more infos about Cobedias under http://cobedix.ch/. In a nutshell, Cobedias is a medical software which records patients data and helps recognizing deseases by comparing patient data to other anonymized data. 

Our underlying idea heads towards the outsourcing of some parts of the consultation to the patient (aiming at shortening time and expenses on doctor and patient side). Our solution is a frontend based on React JS. For the part of the family anamnesis the family tree of https://github.com/SanichKotikov/react-family-tree was used and completely revised for the projects purpose.  

### How to run it
After cloning the repository to your desktop, you can open it in your IDE. First make sure to have npm installed installed on your machine. Run `npm install` first in your command line in the folder `masterprojekt_cobedias`. Then, start the frontend with `npm start` in the same folder. Accordingly, the prototype will be started on the `localhost:3000` in your chosen browser. If you want to go through the prototype several times creating new entries, make sure to delete data in the local storage in the developers console.
