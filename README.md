# MasterProjekt Cobedias

### Idea and goal
This is the prototype for the Master Project at the Department of Informatics at UZH of Anna, Ivo, Joachim and Fabio. The goal of it is to improve the current Cobedias version with new ideas. You can find more infos about Cobedias under http://cobedix.ch/. In a nutshell, Cobedias is a medical software which records patients data and helps recognizing diseases by comparing patient data to other anonymized data. 

Our underlying idea heads towards the outsourcing of some parts of the consultation to the patient and improve the investigations quality. Our solution is a frontend based on React JS. For the part of the family anamnesis the family tree of https://github.com/SanichKotikov/react-family-tree was used and completely revised for the projects purpose.  

### How to run it
First one has to install npm, the node package manager. If you have a MAC and using OS, you can follow the instructions under https://treehouse.github.io/installation-guides/mac/node-mac.html to set npm up as well as homebrew if not done already. For Windows, you can follow the instructions under https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm to set npm up. 

After having installed npm and cloning the repository to your desktop, you can open it in your IDE. Run `npm install` and navigate in your command line in the folder `masterprojekt_cobedias` by typing `cd masterprojekt_cobedias`. Then, start the frontend with `npm start` in the same folder. Accordingly, the prototype will be started on the `localhost:3000` in your chosen browser. If you want to go through the prototype several times creating new entries, make sure to delete data in the local storage in the developers console. If there are problems with setting up the device, see further information for React on MAC under https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-js-macos-setup and for Windows under https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-js-windows-setup.
